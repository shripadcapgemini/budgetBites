## Objective:

This detailed data-analysis instigated the idea to reduce food-waste targeting Retail and few Household waste-causes to start with, and eventually aiming Food services (Restaurants, Airline, Cruise line, hotels & Resorts, Casinos etc.) and remaining Household causes in near future. Hence, enabling us to contribute to SDG 12.3 clause aiming to “reduce food wastage by 50% at the retail and consumption stage”.

Moreover, SDG 2.1 clause aiming to “end hunger and ensure access by all people (in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations) to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round” instilled the thought to channelize food-waste to ‘needy’ consumers by integrating NGOs through better connectively and wider reachability.


## Solution:

Traditional Households and Retail models (Grocery, Bakeries, Confectionaries, Green Grocers, Wholesalers) struggle to efficiently manage perishable items and near-to-expire products, resulting in substantial food-waste. The problem is more gruesome in case of small townships and small vendors who have limited ‘consumer’ footfall.

 We as “Budget Bites”, sensed the need to reach out to native people to facilitate them with broader connectivity to generate a vast potential ‘Consumer’ base in the form of Residential Societies, Individual Households, NGOs, Restaurants, Street Food Carts, Food Trucks, Other Retailers etc.

 By leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, NLP, “Budget Bites” empowers the ‘Generators’ to stage their perishable/near-to-expiry products to wider ‘Consumers’ by uploading their products on its easy-to-use platform in their preferred language. “Budget Bites” supports selling as well as charity purposes:

·‘Discounted Sale’ (key features being Automated pricing recommendations based on expiration, flexible discounting options, real-time notifications etc.)

·‘Gifting’ (key features being real-time notifications, pre-booking, Recommendation facilitations, etc.)

With “Budget Bites”, both ‘Generators’ and ‘Consumers’ can embrace an efficient, optimized, and sustainable approach towards reduction of food-wastage along with contributing to social upliftment with additional benefits of reduced energy and carbon footprint.
